# Iris Rev. 4 Tenting Layer
An [Iris Rev. 4](https://keeb.io/collections/keyboard-pcbs/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard) bottom layer with a tent stand.

* This stand features a plate that replaces the stock Iris Keyboard bottom plate but that has legs to create ergonomic tenting. 

* The keyboard is angled at an 10.5 degree roll and a 6 degree pitch. The included Fusion 360 model allows simple parametric control over these angles.

* To install, use the plate's original screws to attach the new plate+stand.
